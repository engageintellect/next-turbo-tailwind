## Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/engageintellect/turbo-next-sveltekit-tailwind.git
cd turbo-next-sveltekit-tailwind
pnpm i && pnpm run dev
```

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `init`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `sveltekit`: a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by `web`, `docs`, and `int` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd next-turbo-tailwind
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd next-turbo-tailwind
pnpm i && run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
